# Day 23

## Today's Progress
- Started **Problem Set 2**.

## Thoughts
- This time, the first problem was of medium difficulty and fun to solve. Problems 2 and 3 were easy and didnâ€™t take too long to figure out. I started the fourth one; I just have to add one more function, and then I will be done with that as well.
