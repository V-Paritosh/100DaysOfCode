# Day 17

## Today's Progress
- Began CS50 Python. Set everything up.

## Thoughts
- I wanted to code in local VS Code, which led me to go through unnecessary rabbit holes. After realizing that, I decided I could just create a GitHub repo and post my solution on the online VS Code once it works. I started watching the videos and realized that the terminal path was too long, so I made a script in the `$PROFILE` of PowerShell to reduce it and bring back the full terminal paths.
