# Day 24

## Today's Progress
- Finished **Problem Set 2** and **Lecture 3**.

## Thoughts
- I completed the remaining problems and was able to achieve 100% on the first run of `check50` for all the problems. Lecture 3 covered exceptions, teaching me the correct standards and mindset to adopt when coding, which will be helpful as I progress in complexity.
