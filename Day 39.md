# Day 39

## Today's Progress
- Finished **Lecture 9**.

## Thoughts
- Today was fun because I got to learn about many other cool features of Python. However, the last lecture packed in a lot of information, so Iâ€™ll need to create more projects to fully understand all the new features I learned in this final lecture of CS50 Python.
