# Day 37

## Today's Progress
- Finished **Lecture 8**.

## Thoughts
- Learned how to do OOP in Python, which was cool because, as I was watching the lecture, I was connecting it back to Java. This made the syntax easier due to similar structure, although Python relies on an honor system instead of Java’s private-public type system. This might make coding a bit harder since I’ll have to remember more of the structure and syntax. However, Python’s "pythonic" features are nice because they can make coding faster in some scenarios.
