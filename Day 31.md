# Day 31

## Today's Progress
- Finished **Lecture 5** & Finished **Problem Set 5**.

## Thoughts
- I learned how to use pytest, which is nice, and I discovered the correct way to do testing, which will help a lot in the future. Doing the actual tests wasnâ€™t hard for the first three problems, but the last one required me to set up the old program in a whole new way, and then getting the test to work took a while. Other than that, testing was easy.
