# Day 22

## Today's Progress
- Finished **Lecture 2**.

## Thoughts
- One downside is that in Python, you can't do `i--` or `i++`, which I don't particularly like, but it's not a major issue. However, being able to use `_` in a for loop is nice, and learning about the dictionary array was also interesting.
