# Day 40

## Today's Progress
- Started **Final Project**.

## Thoughts
- I decided to make a password manager that takes the user's 'account' and 'password' and adds them to an encrypted CSV file. It also allows the user to update, delete, and view all passwords after entering the correct password to decrypt the CSV. I was able to get a solid framework done. I just have to improve a few small things to make it work, which should only take a short time tomorrow.
