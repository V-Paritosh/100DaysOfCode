# Day 41

## Today's Progress
- Finished the **Final Project**.

## Thoughts
- I completed the `project` code and the `test_project` code, which didn't take too long since I had already done the more intensive programming yesterday. A fun and new experience was creating the official `README.md` file, as it was a requirement that forced me to think about how I would explain the code to someone else, which I enjoyed. Everything went smoothly, and I was able to get my certificate in just 14 days, which isn't bad at all. Now I need to decide what to do in the upcoming 59 days. Right now, I'm considering either the CS50 AI with Python course or CS50 Cybersecurity.
