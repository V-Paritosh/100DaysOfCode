# Day 28

## Today's Progress
- Started **Problem Set 4**.

## Thoughts
- I got through the first three problems. They weren't hard, but reading through the documentation of different libraries was nice. The Inflect library is cool in that it handles English language rules, and the Figlet library creates text in fun fonts, adding a bit of a hacker feel.
