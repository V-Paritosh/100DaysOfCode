# Day 34

## Today's Progress
- Finished **Problem Set 6**.

## Thoughts
- The last problem was difficult; it required a lot of reading through the documentation, which took a while, but the actual coding wasnâ€™t hard. I had to make a few minor adjustments in the code to pass the check50, which was nice.
