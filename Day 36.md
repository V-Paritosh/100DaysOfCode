# Day 36

## Today's Progress
- Finished **Problem Set 7**.

## Thoughts
- The first two problems were easy and didn’t require a lot of regular expressions. Problem three took a while to create the regular expression and get everything working, since I had to convert a time string to 24-hour format. The last two problems were very easy, especially the last one all I had to do was import a library that already checks if a given email is valid or not, which didn’t take long. Additionally, all the check50 tests were correct for the most part, with only minor fixes that were needed.
