# Day 5

## Todays Progress
- Tried to get the SVG animation to work.
- Removed the GSAP animation and used GPT to create an HTML/CSS animation, which works.
- Now I just need to convert it to React.

## Thoughts
- It's going to be a rough day trying to get the SVG animation to work.
- GPT helps with ideas and provides basic templates for projects to work on.
