# Day 38

## Today's Progress
- Finished **Problem Set 8**.

## Thoughts
- All the problems were easy and quick to solve. The first problem combined previous skills, which was nice. The second problem focused on classes, which helped me understand the new structure. The last problem was fun because I made my online CS50 t-shirt and got to learn how to make custom pdf from code.
